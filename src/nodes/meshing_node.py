    "- How to create points, lines, surfaces, and volumes programmatically "
    "- How to assign physical groups for OpenFOAM compatibility "
    "- How to control mesh sizing and refinement "

    "- Create complex geometries using GMSH Python API "
    "- Set up proper boundary conditions for OpenFOAM "
    "- Implement mesh refinement strategies "
    "- Generate 3D meshes with correct boundary assignments "
    "CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: "
    "- Always generate 3D meshes for OpenFOAM simulations "
    "- Set mesh sizes and generate 3D mesh: gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3) "
    "- AFTER 3D mesh generation, identify surfaces using gmsh.model.getEntities(2) "
    "- Use gmsh.model.getBoundingBox(dim, tag) to analyze surface positions and categorize them "
    "- Do not use gmsh.model.getCenterOfMass(dim, tag) function to analyze surface positions "
    "- Create 2D physical groups based on spatial analysis, not during geometry creation "

    "- For mesh quality issues: adjust mesh sizes, add refinement zones, improve geometry definition "
    "CRITICAL ORDER: Create geometry then Extrude then Synchronize then Generate mesh then create physical groups "
    "CRITICAL: Use bounding box coordinates consistently for ALL boundary types - do not mix center points and bounding box coordinates in the same boundary detection logic "
    "MOST CRITICAL FIX: If boundaries are missing after gmshToFoam, move ALL physical group creation to AFTER gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3) "
    "MOST CRITICAL FIX: Physical groups created before mesh generation will have wrong surface tag references "
    "CRITICAL FACE DETECTION FIXES: "
    "- Fix thin boundary detection: use abs(zmin - zmax) < tol AND (abs(zmin - z_min) < tol OR abs(zmin - z_max) < tol) "

    "- Ensure thin surfaces at z_min and z_max are properly classified as boundary surfaces "
    "- Check that ALL user-specified boundaries are detected and assigned to physical groups "
